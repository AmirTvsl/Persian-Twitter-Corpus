# Persian-Twitter-Corpus
A corpus compiler from twitter API


 Each tweetâ€™s information is not just about the text itself, it contains much more information about the geographical emergence of data, personal information, account information and a lot more. So the texts contain additional tagged information just like annotated corpora for training Natural Language Understanding models.
